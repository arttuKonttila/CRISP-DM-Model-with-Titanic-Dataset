# CRISP-DM Model with Titanic Dataset  

This project demonstrates the application of the **CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)** methodology to analyze the famous Titanic dataset. The goal of the project was to explore the dataset, extract meaningful insights, and build a predictive model to determine the survival likelihood of passengers. This project was completed as part of a course at **JAMK University of Applied Sciences**.

## CRISP-DM Phases  

1. **Business Understanding**  
   The objective of this project was to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on their demographic and socio-economic features.  

2. **Data Understanding**  
   - Explored the Titanic dataset to identify patterns, missing data, and feature distributions.  
   - Visualized key insights using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.  

3. **Data Preparation**  
   - Cleaned and transformed data using **pandas**.  
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables for modeling.  

4. **Modeling**  
   - Built and evaluated predictive models using **scikit-learn**.  
   - Compared multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Assessed model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.  
   - Performed cross-validation to ensure model reliability.
